                Overview
            </h2>

            <p class="main-content">
                The goal of this assignment is to 
                work in a groups to design an interactive 
                interface for an emerging startup. 
                Our group went through the full process of 
                mocking up a solution to the startup's concept.

                Selecting Our Startup
            </h2>

            <p class="main-content">
                The startup we have chosen is Vizzly.<br>

                Vizzly is an embeddable analytics tool which 
                companies can plug into their customer-facing apps. 
                Instead of delivering a predefined dashboard to users, 
                companies can offer a flexible dashboard builder for 
                users to answer questions and track metrics specific 
                to them.

                Sketching and Wireframing
            </h2>

            <p class="main-content">
                The sketches were created using plain hand 
                drawing. Among the 4 of us, we created three 
                different sketches each for three different screens 
                that we envisioned the Vizzly application to contain 
                without peeking into their actual website.

            <p class="main-content">
                After we finished our individual sketches, we gathered as a group and cumulated
                all our ideas into one set of wireframes. Through these, we tried to demonstrate 
                solutions to the company's goals, as well as reflect creative ideas and alternate 
                solutions.

                We then proceeded to make an interactive high-fidelity (hi-fi) prototype based

                Some of the reviews we received during our crit studio session are as follows:
            </p>

            <div>
                <ul class="list-style">
                    <li>Right now, a user might interpret the e-commerce dashboard as a shared dashboard because it's under a button that says shared dashboards</li>
                    <li>Logo is good to return to main dashboard, but you can go so many layers deep that it might be helpful to have a local “back” button</li>
                    <li>“Select data source” brings to a different page, which might not be expected behavior</li>
                    <li>The side navigation bar feels great</li>
                    <li>I was a little confused about what the “Your Dashboards” page is displaying for a minute</li>
                    <li>If "shared dashboards" is available on the nav bar on the side, I feel like it shouldn't be on the “your dashboards” page as a rectangle</li>
                    <li>I think the Account Details page might need a little bit more info; for example, to change the password, the user should probably enter the original password in the first place</li>
                    <li>Consider keeping the “Create New Dashboard” and “Shared Dashboards” the same color and adding affordances to the button to better distinguish between the two</li>
                    <li>With the navbar on the left side, the main content of your page, notably on the “Your Dashboards,” “Shared Dashboards,” “Account Details,” “eCommerce,” and “Traffic by Device” pages, is a little off center</li>
                    <li>This might only be visible in prototype mode, but on some pages, the page header (e.g. Traffic by Device), is partially blocked off by the computer camera</li>
                </ul>

                Using the Vizzly portal, create a new dashboard and connect an existing data source which would

                <em>
                All users had no difficulties creating a new dashboard. 
                Many were able to fluently switch back and forth between 
                Your Dashboard and Shared Dashboard. Users' actions 
                matched our expectations.
                <br>
                When accessing the “eCommerce” dashboard and analyzing 
                the data, all users had no difficulties accessing the 
                newly created dashboard. Many users were satisfied with 
                how the dashboard was organized and the different types 
                of data that were displayed. 
                A minority of users complained that some of the graphs 
                were unclear (hard to understand) and that there 
                should be an option to export the graphs.                 
                Users' actions matched our expectations, but some of 
                the complaints surprised us.
                <br>
                When changing account details, many users had no 
                difficulty changing the account details. Users' 
                actions matched our expectations
                Some additional comments that were repeated included 
                that the color scheme is unsatisfactory. 
                The navigation bar was resourceful. Overall 
                functionality is very simple and accessible.
                Generally, many users successfully finished all 
                tasks and proficiently used Vizzly. 
                There weren't any “errors” in terms of completing 
                the tasks, but they did raise a couple key points
                that could be improved on. 
                <br><br>
                Some potential interface changes include: <br>
                <ul class="list-style" style="align-items: center;">
                <li>Export button for the graphs</li>
                <li>Adding a “Create New” wording next to the + sign</li>
                <li>Changing the colors to be more natural tone</li>
                <li>Easier and more visible options to sort/edit analytics</li>
